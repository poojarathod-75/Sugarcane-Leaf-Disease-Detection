Title: Sugarcane Leaf Disease Detection using YOLOv8

An AI-based system to detect sugarcane leaf diseases using deep learning and computer vision.

📌 About the Project
This project uses the YOLOv8 object detection model to identify sugarcane leaf diseases such as Mosaic, Red Rot, Rust, Yellow Leaf disease, and Healthy leaves from images. It helps farmers detect diseases early and reduce crop loss.

🚀 Key Features
- Detects multiple sugarcane leaf diseases
- Real-time image-based disease detection
- Bounding boxes with disease name and confidence score
- User-friendly web interface for image upload
- Fast and accurate detection using YOLOv8

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas
- Flask / Streamlit
- HTML, CSS
- Google Colab

🎯 Objective
To provide a fast, accurate, and automated solution for early detection of sugarcane leaf diseases and support smart agriculture.

🌾 Impact
- Reduces manual inspection
- Improves crop yield
- Saves time and cost for farmers
- Promotes AI-based smart farming
